                            <p>The road gets foggy whenever I'm out. Tidal waves of clouds fill up my lungs, and I know that I can't fly. As my legs transport my soul past each house, I glance at each structure in wonder of its condition. The sides don't need to be torn for it to be abandoned, and the windows don't need to be cracked for it to be smeared. Even with the chimney there's still some smoke left behind, and as a stream escapes it can't help but to unwind and poison the air. With every breath I take I get more used to this new life source, and as I go blind I wonder more and more where my own home is, and I can't roam along a street that isn't my own.</p>
                            <p>I don't need to find my sight, I just need an idea on where to go. What leads me there I don't care, I just need to breathe some fresh air. My mind and heart lost connection, so it looks like I'm on my own, trapped visionless inside nature's smog with a building next to me standing alone.</p>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>As days go by you start to think more, think about from where you came, and even though we conquer mountains and explore space, we haven't figured out how not to live in shame. I recovered from my mind nerve endings that tell the tale of a me who once lived and just wanted to survive, when I won't; I can just live and hope that I fulfill all the dreams for which I strive. Dreams are incomplete realities, they are events that may or may not occur, but they're never as great as how they transported within your brain, a sign that nothing can be pure.</p>
                            <p>And I don't mind, because I don't need perfection to be amongst the freed. But whatever happens isn't in my control, and I've never been filled with greed.</p>
                            <p>The roads we take may not be paved at the start, but our strides lay down foundations while our footprints solidify the decisions, and the more we walk the more we obey our hearts.</p>
                            <p>The concrete molds as we influence its strength along the way, with cracks and scars forming from the misfortunes experienced during the day. And leaves spread out amongst these newly created lanes, fallen victims from the trees who can't deal with the pain.</p>
                            <p>The wind strays the green, and with every gust the roads are covered with the nature that's left to be seen. The sun shows its gleam, the darkness engulfed by temporary, illuminated beams.</p>
                            <p>The light shows off the roads that we've made our own, and they intersect at spots where the cracks appear to have grown. Our lives are segments on chains that rust away with use, the strength withers away, the entwined silver parts weathered loose. But when we fall to the ground we fall as a whole, the concurrent harmonies echo and fade within the vastness of a black hole.</p>
                            <p>And I realize that I don't want to make it out of here alive; I just want to learn to coexist with other segments of chains that I may have to witness fall at the end of their fruitless attempts to survive. And I know that when our roads crossed that we were both going to grow and learn, and that someday in my brain these nerve endings would fire as I reminisced back to this time when I gained something new that made my soul burn.</p>
                            <p>We evolve every minute as we walk the roads we've grounded, and you get to look back at any point in your journey and examine a part of it that you had the honor to travel.</p>

                            <p>I sacrificed more when I went away.<br />
                            I was definitely more inclined to leave but I just couldnâ€™t stay.<br />
                            I wanted to buy my books and read them with you, but they were burnt when they were given to me.<br />
                            And as hard as it seemed to replace the lost words, somehow I managed to picture what they would be.<br />
                            Thereâ€™ll be some sense of victory when I run away, but that was my original regret;<br />
                            Leaving behind all the memories that I suppose Iâ€™d be willing to lose in a bet,<br />
                            And I hope the escape will be just as triumphant as when I wanted to get free.<br />
                            As I gain the life I deserve Iâ€™ll be contemplating all the moments Iâ€™ll no longer be able to see.<br />
                            My lifeâ€™s a crossroad that I switch at times to dwell on decisions that need to be made.<br />
                            The one Iâ€™m on reached a dead-end and now I know thereâ€™s no more foundation to be laid.<br />
                            Iâ€™ve found the road that fits my needs that Iâ€™ll look back at when I need to know whatâ€™s being kept out of mind,<br />
                            And that regardless of my thoughts whatever happens will never hinder the progress of our hearts becoming intertwined.<br />
                            I sacrificed more when I went away,<br />
                            And I donâ€™t think I can stay.<br /></p>

                            <p>
                                Iâ€™m on this island whenever I wanna be alone.<br />
                                I live with no one because I wanna claim it as my own.<br />
                                I contemplate life and where I should be instead of being there.<br />
                                I wonder where Iâ€™ll go or even if Iâ€™ll go anywhere.<br />
                                What if I were to fall into an abyss and be suspended in mid-air for what seems like forever?<br />
                                Could I have ever hit the ground if my life hadnâ€™t been severed?<br />
                                Iâ€™ll just expand and implode from the inside until all matter has disappeared.<br />
                                Time will impede the dirty hourglass to the point of it eventually having to be cleared.<br />
                                And Iâ€™m just one who enjoys theories about how Iâ€™ll die,<br />
                                But some things werenâ€™t created to be lies.<br />
                                Iâ€™ve ascended up to where I never wouldâ€™ve known.<br />
                                A white shirt forced on me that desperately needed to be sewn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Iâ€™ll live according to what others would want to see.<br />
                                Iâ€™ll die because of actions made by others that were supposed to be made by me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fire enters my soul to inflame who I am.<br />
                                I wanna run from the pain but I donâ€™t have a lot of land.<br />
                                Wherever I go I hope I find a cure.<br />
                                I donâ€™t really care about my decisions, I just canâ€™t admit Iâ€™m not pure.<br />
                                Let me go blind from reality and envision my past.<br />
                                Even though Iâ€™m sure of all of this thereâ€™s just something about me that believes sheâ€™ll end up not wanting this to last.<br />
                                Itâ€™s not healthy to worry about what could happen,<br />
                                When one day Iâ€™ll wake up and youâ€™ll be smearing my stain with a napkin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Iâ€™ll live according to what others would want to see.<br />

                                Looking out to the horizon there's a scene not many can see,<br />
                                Ships sailing across the pond yet stopped in its tracks from getting where it needs to be.<br />
                                Blasts heard from afar that signify blood and gore,<br />
                                But what more can you expect from a time of war?<br />
                                For every 100 ships at sea there're 100 shipwrecks,<br />
                                With passengers awaiting their fate as the water reaches the level of the decks.<br />
                                Bombs fall to paint a fiery picture that'll light up the sky,<br />
                                An inferno on the water burning the target as much as it burns my eyes,<br />
                                And it won't cease to smolder either the metal or the pain,<br />
                                But from here there'll only be something that we can gain.<br />
                                In a war that has claimed the lives of some of my dearest friends,<br />
                                The last thing I'd ever want to do is even attempt to make amends,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I'm powerless, and there's only one foe,<br />
                                And letting them win would be amongst my greatest woes.<br />
                                I need to try, I can't just sit here and accept these lies, I need this before it dies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that's why I stay in the harbor, safe at the docks,<br />
                                Where the only weapon used against me are ticking clocks.<br />
                                I'm away from the torment that hostility can provide,<br />
                                And I'm not a traitor, I'm just confused about my pride and why when there's a commodity I should chase I choose to hide.<br />
                                The urge to go out on the open sea is strong,<br />
                                But having ambitions and desires doesn't mean something can't go wrong.<br />
                                Oh, how I wish I were in an airplane, flying over this battle of mixed hate and love,<br />
                                Strafing all the ships as I glide safely above,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I'm powerless, and there's only one foe,<br />
                                And letting them win would be amongst my greatest woes.<br />
                                I need to try, I can't just sit here and accept these lies, I need this before it dies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And as I hear about the treaty with no essence,<br />
                                The sun starts to hide, mocking us with its potential luminescence.<br />
                                As warfare fades, the ships begin to jade from the constant waves that cause them all to wade.<br />
                                And in the back of my mind I sense a chance for me to shine.<br />
                                Even in the impending darkness I believe it'll all be fine,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I'm powerless, and there's only one foe,<br />
